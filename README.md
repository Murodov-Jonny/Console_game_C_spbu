This console-based game, written in C, is titled "Hungry Dog Passing Through Walls". The game emulates a dog's movement within a bordered grid, where the objective is to maneuver the dog without hitting the walls or its own tail. The game includes the dog represented by the character '@', its tail by '.', and the apple by '*'. The dog moves through user input ('w', 's', 'a', 'd' keys for up, down, left, and right respectively) and tries to reach the apple, increasing its length upon consumption. However, collision with the borders or itself ends the game, prompting a "Game over" message. The game is controlled via the keyboard, and the grid is displayed in the console
